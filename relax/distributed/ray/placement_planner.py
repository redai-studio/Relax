"""Placement planning for the inference roles (rollout, GenRM, OPD teacher).

From the run configuration alone, work out which bundle range of which
placement group every inference model occupies, and reject layouts in which
two models would hold GPU memory on the same bundles at the same time.

Two layers:

- Rule layer: immutable pools/claims plus the capacity and conflict checks.
  It knows nothing about ``args``.
- Adapter layer: ``plan_placement(args)`` turns the run configuration into
  pools and claims and runs the checks.

Coordinates are indices into a placement group's bundle list sorted by
``(node, gpu id)``, i.e. the ``reordered_*`` lists ``create_placement_group``
returns. Validation is logical only: node boundaries and GPU-id contiguity
depend on the real placement group and are not checked here.
